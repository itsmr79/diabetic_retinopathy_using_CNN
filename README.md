# Diabetic_retinopathy_using_CNN
This project aims to develop a system to detect and classify whether the patient is having diabetic retinopathy or not. If the patient is affected with diabetic retinopathy, the system predicts the severeness of the disease. so that appropriate treatment can be taken in time.
- We as a team of 5members together completed the project, documentation, and presentation,..etc.
- We introduced a deep learning model to extract the features from the fundus images and to classify the image upon prediction.
- The deep learning model we've used was "INCEPTION V3", which was developed and retrained by Google on the large ImageNet dataset.
- The total files related to the project were uploaded into this repository, where you can find the
