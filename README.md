# Diabetic_retinopathy_using_CNN
This project aims to develop a system to detect and classify whether the patient has diabetic retinopathy or not. If the patient is affected with diabetic retinopathy, the system predicts the severity of the disease. So that, appropriate treatment can be taken in time.
- We as a team of 5members together completed the project, documentation, presentation,..etc.
- We introduced a deep learning model to extract the features from the fundus images and to classify the image upon prediction.
- The deep learning model we used was "INCEPTION V3", which was developed and pretrained by Google on the large ImageNet dataset.
- We trained and tested the model at different ratios of training and testing images, and found the corresponding accuracy.
- The final result was analyzed with Rate of Acceptance and Rate of Rejection and tabulated the results.
- The total files related to the project were uploaded into this repository, where you can find the
